##This dataset evaluate predictor that are believe to influence student scores
Student_scores = read.csv("Student_scores.csv")
head(Student_scores)

M <-cor(Student_scores)
corrplot(M, type="upper", order="hclust",
         col=brewer.pal(n=8, name="RdYlBu"))

##Let's look at the dataset and the variables associated to it...

##1. we don't need the student ID, we can drop that variable
##2. the variables race, ses and prog have multiple levels, we have two options leave them that way, or create dummy variables
##If you have more levels >2 per node then the fold changes calculations need to address the multiple levels

# Create dummy variable
data <- dummy_cols(Student_scores, 
                   select_columns = c("race","ses","prog"))

#We can subset now to keep the variables we need only
data2 = data[,c(2,5,7:21)]

##For the analysis we are going to run we want to discretize the continuous variables
library(bnlearn)
##Split variables to discretize
data_ToDiscrete = data2[,c(3:7)]
##Convert these variables to numeric
data_ToDiscrete = data.frame(apply(data_ToDiscrete, 2, as.numeric))

##Let's discretize in two levels
data_disc = discretize(data_ToDiscrete, 
                                  method = "hartemink", breaks = 2,
                                  ibreaks = 3, idisc = "quantile")

##Combine binary and discretized variables
data_final = cbind(data2[,c(1,2,8:17)],data_disc)

data_final = data_final %>% mutate_if(is.factor,as.numeric)
M2 <-cor(data_final)
corrplot(M2, type="upper", order="hclust",
         col=brewer.pal(n=8, name="RdYlBu"))

##Now we can create a network with all of the variables
library(bnlearn)
##Convert all variables to factors
data_final <- data_final %>% mutate_if(is.numeric,as.factor)

###Apply a bootstrapping approach with 500 runs, using the greedy HC algorithm
net_bnlearn = boot.strength(data = data_final, R = 500, algorithm = "hc",algorithm.args = list(score = "bde",iss=10))

##Query
net_bnlearn[net_bnlearn$strength>0.85 & (net_bnlearn$direction>=0.5),]

##What is the best threshold of strength to segment the network? 
averaged.network(net_bnlearn)

##Construct and averaged network
avg.boot = averaged.network(net_bnlearn, threshold = 0.5)


#net_bnlearn = hc(data_final, score = "bde",iss=10,)

##Attach probability tables to the structure we just learned
fitted = bn.fit(avg.boot, data_final, method = "bayes")

##One way to plot the network
library(graph)
library(igraph)
g <- igraph.from.graphNEL(as.graphNEL(fitted))

plot(g)
