### A biomedical informatics researcher is investigating the relationship between smoking and multiple biological measurements. We want to compare the mean age for both smokers and non-smokers and we want to sample participants from each group proportionally to their representation in the population. The dataset smoking.csv contains this information, with two columns: "age" (numeric) and "smoking" (factor with 2 levels "0" and "1" [yes/no]). Answer the following questions using the concepts seen in class.

#### 1. **Point Estimate:**
####   Calculate the mean age for the entire population based on the collected sample.

#### 2. **Random Sampling:**
####   Randomly select a subset of 50 patients from the dataset without replacement. Calculate the mean age for this subset.

#### 3. **Resampling:**
####   Perform bootstrapping on the entire dataset to estimate the sampling distribution of the mean age for the cohort Use 1000 bootstrap samples and calculate the mean age for each sample.

#### 4. **Confidence Intervals:**
####   Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean age level using the bootstrap distribution obtained in the previous step.

#### 5. **Standard Error of the Mean (SEM):**
####   Calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM) of your estimate.

### Markov Chain: physical exercise training method A is used only 5% of the time, a person using method A will stay with this method 85% of the time, and a person not using method A will switch to method A about 65% time. At the beginning of the experiment only 5% of people used method A.

#### 1. Generate a transition matrix for this Markov chain
#### 2. Generate a transition plot (using R or by hand as an image itâ€™s valid)
#### 3. Plot the change in the probabilities over time for both methods until the 10th time unit.

## 3. 

### Random Walk: Another simpler example of a random walk is a one-dimensional random walk. first we place a marker at zero (our initial state), we flip a coin, if it lands on heads, the marker is moved one unit to the right (1), if it lands on tails it is moved one unit to the left.

#### 1. Generate a function that randomly draws from our initial state and populates a vector with the different transitions.

#### 2. Generate a plot that shows 500 independent one-dimensional walks, differentiating walks that end above 0 or below 0.

#### 3. What is the frequency of walks that ended in a positive cumulative count, in zero, or negative?
